<h1>Ergonomic Tips for Computer Users</h1><br>
Prolonged use of a computer keyboard and/or mouse can lead to frequent muscle aches and nerve pain unless a few guidelines are followed.<br> You can work more comfortably and safely if you incorporate the following ergonomic tips into your work style:<br>
<b>Posture And Positioning</b><br>
•	Maintain good posture when working at the keyboard. Utilize a chair with back support. <br>
•	Keep your feet supported on the floor or on a footrest when you work to reduce pressure on your lower back<br>
•	Avoid twisting or bending your trunk or neck. Frequently used items should be positioned directly in front of you and angled upward on a copyholder when working. <br>
•	Keep your shoulders relaxed with your elbows close to your sides.<br>
•	Avoid resting your elbows on the hard surface or edge of your table. Pads can be used to protect your elbows if necessary.<br>
•	Elbows should be positioned at 100 to 110 degrees when working in order to keep a relaxed position at the keyboard. <br>This could require a slight negative tilt (front of keyboard higher than back) when working in upright positions. <br>If reclined in your chair, the keyboard could be at a positive angle to maintain this relaxed position.<br>
•	Your wrists should be in a neutral or straight position when keying or using a pointing device or calculator. <br>Wrist rests can assist you in maintaining a neutral position when used properly during pauses. <br>Float your arms above the keyboard and wrist rest when keying. <br>Avoid planting your wrists on the table or wrist rest. This can result in bending the wrists either up and down or side to side.<br>
•	Take breaks. These breaks can be brief and should include stretches for optimal results. <br>If possible, take a one or two-minute break every 15 to 20 minutes, or a five-minute break every hour. <br>Every few hours, get up, move around, and do an alternative activity.<br>
<b>Work Technique</b><br>
•	Reduce keystrokes with the use of macros or software programs allowing "sticky keys."<br> Use scroll locks and keystroke combinations to reduce pointing-device movements.<br>
•	Alternate tasks to make changes in your working position to avoid making the same movements for prolonged periods of time.<br>
•	Keep your fingers and knuckles relaxed when working at the keyboard.<br>
•	Never hold a pen or pencil in your hand when keying.<br>
•	Avoid hitting the keyboard with excessive force.<br> Studies have shown that the average user hits the keyboard with four times the required force when keying.<br>
•	Avoid holding your pointing device tightly. Your hand should be relaxed.<br>
•	Rest your eyes by refocusing on distant objects intermittently when working.<br>
<b>Work Environment</b><br>
•	Avoid excessive reaching. Your keyboard, pointing device, files and telephone should be within easy reach.<br>
•	Use a keyboard tray to properly position your keyboard and pointing device.<br>
•	Use a copyholder positioned in line with your monitor and keyboard.<br>
•	When writing at the computer, avoid excessive reaching over the keyboard or work materials.<br> A sturdy in-line copyholder can double as a writing surface if appropriately positioned.<br>
•	Position the monitor so that the viewed part of the screen allows you to keep your neck in a neutral or straight position.<br> The monitor should be centered directly in front of you. <br>The top of the computer screen should be slightly below the top of your head, so that you are looking at it with a slightly downward gaze.<br>
•	Position your monitor to eliminate excessive glare or reflections from windows and lighting.<br>
•	Customize your computer by using your software. The screen font, contrast, pointer size, speed, and color can all be adjusted to maximize your comfort and efficiency.<br>
    <b>Lifestyle</b><br>
•	Aerobic exercise will help to sustain strength, improve cardiovascular conditioning, and counteract the strain of sedentary computer use.<br>
•	Routine use of non-prescribed medications or a wrist brace is not recommended. If you begin to develop symptoms, notify your supervisor.<br> Slight changes made early can avoid future complications.<br>
<h1>Computer Safety</h1><br>
Using a computer is not generally thought of as being one of the most hazardous activities to engage in.<br> Yet health and safety risks do exist for both adults and children.<br>
Internet Safety/Child Protection<br>
While the internet serves as a wonderful educational tool, <br>It is an unregulated one and teachers, parents and children should be aware of the inherent dangers of using the world wide web<br> And should not that accessing material on computers, mobile phones or other devices. <br>Caution needs to be exercised to ensure that children do not access unsuitable adult material on the internet:<br>
•	Home/school/company internet contracts should be in place<br>
•	Preview internet material to be used for any company<br>
•	Computers should be placed in public areas and screen content should be visible to everyone<br>
•	Teach children how to use the internet safely and warn them of the potential dangers of unsuitable sites and chat rooms<br>
•	Advise children never to give out personal details on the internet<br>
•	Have clear penalties in place for misuse of the internet<br>
•	Monitor time children spend online<br>
•	Purchase filtering software.<br>
Many companies now have their own websites. <br>Within the company website ensure that no individual child could be identified <br> One should also ensure that network is subsequently contacted by visitors to the site.<br>
For advice for anyone concerning using the internet safely, go to Childnet.<br>

<b>Physical Hazards</b><br>
Accidents involving computers are increasing year after year as more people use computers both at work and at home. <br>In 1998 around 1,500 people in the UK went to hospital as a result of an accident in the home involving a computer1.<br> To give some examples:<br>
•	A six-year-old boy suffered burns from a fire caused by spilling a drink on a computer<br>
•	A nine-year-old boy suffered a head injury after a computer stored on top of a wardrobe fell on him<br>
•	A nine-year-old girl was treated for bruising after falling down the stairs while attempting to move her computer<br>
•	A 15-year-old boy needed treatment for cuts after he threw his arms up in the air after winning a computer game <br>And then brought his arm down on a glass on the desk
•	An 18-year-old man suffered the effects of an electric shock whilst setting up his computer<br>
•	A 38-year-old man suffered a sprained wrist after playing computer games for five hours.<br>
Computers should not be seen as toys but as items of electrical equipment to be treated with respect.<br>
<b>Tips to minimise the risk of a computer-related accident:</b><br>
•	Site your computer near an electric socket to avoid trailing wires across the floor; <br>If you use an extension cable make sure it doesn't overheat and nobody can trip over it<br>
•	Take care not to overload electric sockets; use trailing multi-socket units rather than plug adapters<br>
•	Always follow installation and service instructions in your computer guidebook closely. <br>If in doubt, leave it to the experts<br>
•	Electricity and water do not mix - keep drinks and plants well away from computers<br>
•	Regularly check all electrical equipment for damaged plugs or frayed cables<br>
•	Computers are large and bulky pieces of equipment, move them only if you feel confident in doing so,<br> And with care, especially up and down stairs. Use a trolley and a lift and ask for help. <br>Do not allow children to move computers<br>
•	Do not allow children to play on or with computer swivel chairs<br>
•	Make sure the computer is sited in a position where you have plenty of room to move and to get out of the room in an emergency.<br>
<b>Health Risk</b><br>
There are a number of health risks from using computers, <br>Most of which can be minimised or eliminated by awareness of the risks and by following advice available.<br>
<b>Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)</b><br>
RSI results from performing repetitive movements, <br>E.g. using the mouse, for a long period of time. <br>The following tips are among many that will help you to avoid RSI:<br>
•	Organise workloads to avoid using the computer for extended periods of time<br>
•	Your screen, keyboard and mouse should be directly in front of you<br>
•	Using document holders avoids having to lean over and bend your neck while looking at paperwork<br>
•	Make sure the space underneath your desk is free from clutter and your legs have room to move<br>
•	Use your mouse as close to the keyboard as possible<br>
•	Adopt good posture while at the computer<br>
•	Know how to adjust your chair to the most comfortable position<br>
•	Minimise head and neck movements by altering the height of your monitor<br>
•	Small people and children should use footrests<br>
•	Wrist rests are not for use while typing, but for resting the wrists between spells of typing.<br>
<b>Strained Eyes</b><br>
Working for long periods of time on the computer can strain your eyes or can worsen existing eye conditions. <br>Symptoms include eye discomfort, headaches, itchy eyes and difficulty in focusing. <br>It is important to rest the eyes while working on the computer.<br> Regularly look at more distant objects, e.g. use thinking time to look out of the window, and take frequent breaks from computer work.<br> Visit the optician for regular eye check-ups and make sure you tell them if you are a frequent computer user.<br>
<b>Stress</b><br>
Computer work can be stressful. <br>Take frequent breaks and avoid work overload.<br>
<b>Emotional Safety Considerations</b><br>
Extract from Professor Tyron Review March 2008 p33-34<br>
Safer Children in a Digital World<br>
Exposure to technology could offer opportunities for families to enrich their child's capacity to understand emotions, <br> Or feelings and moral values, or could both extend or displace this important communicative learning experience.<br>
 One of the key ways children learn about emotions, feelings and moral transgressions is by discussing feelings,<br> Even motions and behaviour (usually in the family context). <br>Technology could provide a context in which families could extend this kind of learning in the child through shared experiences and discussions around, <br>for example, the morality of content or, alternatively, it could have a detrimental impact if these discussions do not take place <br> And are replaced by excessive exposure to potentially inappropriate material that is not then discussed.<br>
 These basic forms of social learning experiences are used by some researchers to suggest that,<br> For example, playing violent video games causes harm and could lead to long term behaviour problems and violent tendencies. <br>From what we know about children's development it seems that the nature of the experience during a video game might be very important in determining children's subsequent behaviour;<br> Although quite what the long-term impact of this might be, or what other factors in the child's individual make-up <br> Or experience modulate this learning mechanism is unclear and needs to be considered as we take a probability of risk approach.<br>
 However, it does appear that the child's social context is an important factor in mediating learning through game playing <br> i.e. violent content may lead to sustained learning about violent behaviour in children where violence is the norm (the game playing reinforcing and validating real world experiences). <br>This is supported by evidence that some brain mechanisms (e.g. mirror neurones) appear to be experience-dependent and only respond to actions that the person has previously experienced (Johnson, 2008).<br> Therefore, if mirror neurones are only fired by the experience of violent online or game content in children who have experienced violence themselves,<br> We can begin to speculate that longer term effects of negative or inappropriate content will be more likely to be seen in children who have similar negative experiences in the real world.<br> More research is needed to clarify this so that we can identify which children are more vulnerable.<br>
 Furthermore, although we do not know how children learn from virtual reality, ,<br>It is possible that if virtual experience outweighs other socialisation experiences,<br> These virtual realities could have a dominating effect on how children perceive the world and the expectations their brains set up.<br>
Action and interaction online may have an impact on children's sense of self and be a particular risk<br>Especially for those who are already vulnerable in the offline world.<br>
Other concerns about the role of harmful or inappropriate material in technology is how children use online or virtual information <br>Or experiences to develop a sense of self – the inner working model of ourselves which drives how we think and feel about ourselves and in turn affects how we behave<br> For Example emotional regulation, impulse control, self monitoring<br>For example, within some virtual worlds there is the potential to develop a new identity (called an 'avatar') <br>and this raises the question of how this might affect the development of a young person's sense of 'self'.<br> For the majority of people, the impact of new media on the development of the self are likely to be relatively insignificant<br> since the system for developing it is strongly linked to very early attachment relationships in the offline world e.g. with parents and carers.<br> However, individuals who are vulnerable due to a poor early attachment experience,<br> This may turn to the internet to create a false identity e.g. via an avatar or to create a false profile on a social networking site which will allow them to change their representations of themselves, at least online.<br>This could potentially have an impact on enabling them to work through difficult factors and increase self esteem when all else in their lives is difficult – to experience life as a different person. <br>An important question here is what the impact of this might be on a vulnerable person and whether children's perceptions of themselves in real life are significantly affected by their other fantasy 'selves' <br> This of which in turn may impact on their behaviour towards themselves and others either positively negatively.<br>
 However there is clear evidence of harm within the virtual world when vulnerable children with a poor sense of self and low self esteem are 'seduced' <br>And flattered by others who represent themselves falsely within the virtual world (e.g. online predators pretending to be children) (CEOP, 2007).<br>
Although this is a small risk, epileptic seizures can be triggered by computer work, usually through excessive screen flicker.<br> Know what to do if a child has an epileptic seizure.<br> (National Society for Epilepsy, 01494 601300, www.epilepsynse.org.uk).<br>
   <h1> Tips for Using a Computer Mouse</h1>
The following tips can help you avoid a mouse-related musculoskeletal injury. <br>The same posture principles apply to other input devices (e.g,. trackball, touchpad, pen, digitizing puck etc.).<br>
<b>Mouse grip:</b><br>Hold the mouse gently to move it over a mousing surface.<br>
Mouse from the elbow: Don't skate or flick the mouse with your wrist.<br> Make controlled mouse movements using your elbow as the pivot point and keep your wrist straight and neutral.<br>
   <b> Optimal mouse position:</b><br> Sit back in your chair, relax your arms then lift your mousing hand up,<br> Pivoting at the elbow, until your hand is just above elbow level. <br>Your mouse should be positioned somewhere around this point.<br> Don't use a mouse by stretching to the desk or out to the side of a keyboard.<br>
<b>Right-handed users: </b>Use a position-adjustable, flat-mouse platform and adjust this to a position that is one to two inches above the keyboard and over the numeric keypad; <br>You can easily move the platform out of the way if you need to access the numeric keypad keys. <br>If you need to access the numeric keypad or if you do not have space for an over-the-keyboard mouse platform, <br>Then use an angle-adjustable mouse platform that is immediately to the right side of the keyboard. <br>Position this mouse platform so that it slopes downwards and is close to the side of the keyboard; this will enable you to use the mouse in a neutral wrist position.<br> Position adjustable mouse platforms are commercially available. <br>
   <b> Left-handed users:</b><br> If you are using a left-handed keyboard with the numeric keypad on the left side, <br>You can use an over-the-keyboard mouse pad as described above.<br> If you want to mouse with your left hand but have a right-handed keyboard, <br>then you do not need to use an over-the-keyboard platform because this will obscure some of the alphabetic keys.<br> In this situation it is best to use an angle-adjustable mouse platform that is immediately to the left side of the keyboard,<br> And to position this platform so that your left wrist is neutral as described above. <br>
    <b>Protect your wrist:</b><br> The anatomy of the wrist is curved away from any contact surface.<br> (You can easily see this by resting your hand/arm on a flat surface—you'll see light under the wrist<br> And can probably even pass a thin pen under it.) <br>The forearm is shaped liked this for the wrist to remain free of surface-pressure contact. <br>
    <b>Avoid restricting circulation:</b><br> For many people there are exposed blood vessels near the skin at the wrist, which is where the pulse is often taken. <br>Any pressure in this region will disrupt circulation into the hand and this will increase the risks of injury. <br>
   <b> Don't use a wrist rest:</b><br> Research has shown that using a wrist rest doubles the pressure inside the carpal tunnel,<br> Because the floor of the tunnel is a more flexible ligament that transmits external pressure changes directly into the carpal tunnel.<br> (The roof of the tunnel is bone, so the pressure doesn't get transmitted on through the hand.) Indeed, one test for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), know as Tinel's sign, <br>simply involves tapping on the palm surface of the wrist, which is enough to cause tingling and numbness in someone developing CTS. <br>
    <b>Avoid restricting arm movement:</b> <br>With a softly padded wrist rest (especially one that is rounded) or a soft chair armrest, the forearm becomes locked into position.<br> This encourages people to make mouse movements by flicking their wrists, which also increases intracarpal pressure. <br>
<b>Keep the mouse free-moving: </b><br>The base of the palm is the part of the body designed to support the hand when resting on a surface. <br>For keyboard use a broad palm support is best. <br>However, mouse use is different than keyboard use.<br> With a keyboard the best posture is for users to float their hands over the keyboard when typing and then to rest on the palm support in micro breaks between typing bursts. <br>With mousing this doesn't happen. A mouse is used by moving its location over a surface, and resting usually occurs when mouse movements stop but with the mouse still being held in the hand.<br> Mouse movements should be made using the elbow as the pivot point, not the wrist. <br>Anything that impairs free movement of the forearm/hand and mouse will increase injury risks. <br>
    <b>Mouse shape:</b> <br>Choose a mouse design that fits your hand but is as flat as possible to reduce wrist extension. <br>Don't use a curved mouse. Use a symmetrically shaped mouse.<br> Consider a larger mouse that encourages arm rather than wrist movements. <br>
   <br> Load sharing:</b><br> If you want to load share between your right and left hands, that is using the mouse for some of the time with each hand. <br>For this you need to choose a mouse platform that can easily be configured to the left or/and right or a keyboard platform that can accommodate two mouse platforms, <br>And a symmetrical shaped mouse that can be used by either hand.<br>
    <br>Other input devices:</b><br> Whether you choose a different mouse design, a trackball, a joystick, a pen, a touch pad or some other input device,<br> make sure that your position this comfortably, and that your wrist is in a neutral position when using the device.<br>
